# Real Estate Price Prediction Project

## Introduction
Creating a Machine Learning model to predict the home prices uding the Boston housing data from UCI ML repository. 

Below data science concepts are used in this project
* Data loading and cleaning
* Outlier detection and removal
* Feature Engineering
* Dimensionality reduction
* K fold cross validation

Technology and tools used in this project
* Python
* Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning
* Matplotlib for data visualization
* Sklearn for model building
* Jupyter notebook

## Steps

  ```
  Step#1: Import the required libraries
  Step#2: Load the data
  Step#3: Understand the data
          -drop unnecessary columns
  Step#4: Data Cleaning
          - Check for na values
          - Verify unique values of each column
          - Make sure values are correct 
          - Feature engineering
          - Dimesionality reduction
          - Outlier removal
  Step#5: Build Machine Learning Model
  Step#6: Testing The model
  Step#7: Export the model
  Step#8: Export any other important info
  ```
